            Ely Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in the city of Ely in Cambridgeshire, England. The cathedral can trace its origin to an abbey founded in Ely in 672 by St Ã†thelthryth (also called Etheldreda). The earliest parts of the present building date to 1083, and it was granted cathedral status in 1109. Until the Reformation the cathedral was dedicated to St Etheldreda and St Peter, at which point it was refounded as the Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Ely.</p>
